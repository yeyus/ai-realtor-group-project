* [House Prediction](https://huggingface.co/spaces/rsatish1110/HousePricePrediction/blob/main/app.py) on Hugging Face, it is currently broken because of an issue with hw quota but it references a [dataset](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/tree/master/datasets/housing) that we can take as reference too. It uses radio, which is a library Hugging face provides for easy UI for ML models.
* [Price Recommender](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yxmauw/ames-houseprice-recommender/blob/main/app.py)


### What should the model answer?
This section is to talk about the different options we have to give answers to the users:

* Predict the value of houses for new home buyers. 
* Ask for the requirements to the buyers and give options about the areas they should look for.
